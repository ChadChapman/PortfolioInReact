This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
Please check out that page for more info, the default README is a beast, a very helpful beast that takes a while to read.

## This project came out of an interest in getting some reps with React and Material-UI components.  
### It is also an exercise in the use of white space, a refresher on break-points and `Grid`

My understanding is `Grid` does not play well with IE and its adpotion rate suffers as a result.  YMMV, etc.
